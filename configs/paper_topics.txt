You are interested in research papers that delve into the intersection of causal inference, reinforcement learning, and formal methods, with a particular focus on their application in the field of autonomous driving for safety. 

1. Relevant: Papers that provide insights into how causal inference and reinforcement learning can be combined to improve the safety of autonomous driving systems. This includes papers that discuss novel methodologies, theoretical foundations, and practical applications. Research that explores the use of formal methods in the design and verification of autonomous driving systems, particularly in the context of Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADS) and Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS).

3. Relevant: Papers that discuss the use of large models in enhancing the safety of autonomous driving scenarios or generating autonomous driving scenarios. This could involve the application of large language model, deep learning techniques, machine learning algorithms, or other data-driven approaches.

4. Not Relevant: Papers that primarily focus on application of these methods in domains other than autonomous driving. Also, papers that only tangentially touch on the topics of interest, without these being the core focus of the research.
